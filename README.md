# The Pocket Depth and Authenticity Act Campaign

This repository is dedicated to the campaign for the "Pocket Depth and Authenticity Act," an initiative aiming to change the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act to prohibit the manufacture and sale of trousers, skirts, dresses, and shorts with pockets having a depth of less than seven inches, to ensure the removal of fake pockets in these clothing designs, and to clarify the non-requirement of pockets in clothing items not advertised or appearing to have pockets.
Overview

Many consumers frequently purchase trousers, skirts, dresses, and shorts under the assumption that these items contain functional pockets, only to discover that these pockets are fake or have a depth of less than seven inches. The manufacturing and sale of such items with fake pockets or pockets of insufficient depth is a deceptive practice and causes unnecessary inconvenience and frustration for consumers.

This repository aims to host the discussions, documents, and resources required to bring about this change.
